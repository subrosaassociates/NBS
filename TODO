Everything.
NBS is for bounty hunters who work with the same scope as attackers (no scope)
essentially it's going to be an email form.
but a common criteria to make it clear what the bug is
where the fix should be saught 
a demonstration of an attack
your opinion 
your contact details
-email,phone,other
reward details: if they choose to
credit details: if they choose to
your promis to reach the right person in the organisation before talking about the issue publicly

the idea is a pretty form, some support from security frameworks as a point of refrence (ASVS/OTG/CVSS/etc) 
you'll need to host your own video's but we can refrence them (screencasts) 
create a nice email with some prepopulated stuff to make it easier and cleaner to read 
sling it to a emailing service of your choice to your organisation contact - and CC yourself in for your own records 

====== stage one idea ======

first i'm doing pretty design shit.
